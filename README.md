## Water Quality Analysis and Monitoring Using Remote Sensing 

Water quality characteristics can be monitored using
remote sensing techniques. Geographic information systems use
remote sensing photos as well as the results of imaging analysis as
major data sources like GIS and LANDSAT-8. Remote sensing
enables the simultaneous viewing and mapping of vast areas of the
earth's surface when used in conjunction with field surveys. The
use of remote sensing for weather forecasting is common in India.
Additionally, it is employed to warn people of impending cyclones.
It can be used to investigate issues like eutrophication of large
bodies of water, oil spills from oil tankers, desertification, air
pollution, land degradation, and deforestation. Our issue is the
study of water quality using landsat-8 pictures. Artificial
intelligence (AI) approaches such as MLP, SVM, and group
method of data management were previously used to forecast the
components of water quality. A csv file with the data was selected.
The best accuracy was connected to the RBD as the kernel
function, according to a review of the SVM's structure. The
outcomes showed that its precision is sufficient for practical uses.
The ARIMA model had the lowest level of accuracy. Our
proposed system uses artificial neural networks, such as the
Recurrent Neural Network and ARIMA, to determine the water
quality in coastal areas utilizing remote sensing data. To achieve
a successful result, we select the algorithms that have multilayer
perceptron’s. Additionally, utilizing web technologies and
frameworks, we create a website that will provide weekly updates
on the water quality in a specific location. Water quality
monitoring based on remote sensing imagery mostly use the semiempirical technique. The resolution of the majority of remote
sensing imageries processed by the semi-empirical technique, on
the other hand, is quite poor. For data collecting, the semiempirical technique necessitates a large number of people.
Meanwhile, it has time and space constraints since it cannot
analyze every picture from diverse imaging settings adaptively.
This research presents a unique technique to monitoring water
quality by merging high spatial resolution imageries with
hyperspectral imageries (HSI). ARIMA Time series is based on a
multispectral high spatial resolution picture. The individuals who
live close to those water bodies would become more conscious as a
result. The areas that will profit from this project are those that
are close to water bodies, and those who live there will also be
made aware of the problem of water contamination.
